To packge the application, need to install py2app like:

sudo python3 -m pip install -U py2app

Then create setup.py file:

py2applet --make-setup application.py

Then modify APP variable in setup.py to be "application.py".
And add the 'iconfile' key to the OPTIONS dict with the value of the .icns icon file.
May need to add a 'packages' key to the OPTIONS dict as well with a list of packages that aren't part of the Python standard library.
Probably add 'packages' key to the OPTIONS dict with 'openpyxl' in the value list.

Lastly, run:
python3 setup.py py2app

Now, the .app file will be "double-clickable" inside the dist folder.

Next, we need to create .dmg file in order to distribute the app.
Open diskutil and create image or use DMG Canvas app. Create the .dmg file and send it out.
In order for others to open it however, they need to right click on it and hit open, otherwise they get warning.
To get around warning, must sign the app with an apple developer ID certificate which can get online (only up to 5).
May need to notarize app as well.
